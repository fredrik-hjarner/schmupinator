Before I make a release I should have:
1. Make sure the e2e test works in node.
2. Also run the those tests in the browser too.
3. Make sure to record NEW inputs and e2e recorded data to make sure that tests can be updated.
4. Play through one game from start to end.
5. Test in Firefox, Chrome, Edge and maybe Safari.
