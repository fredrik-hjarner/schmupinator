* After that I should probably take small steps towards making stuff that makes
it easier to make levels, debug texts, debug buttons and tools etc.

* I am adding ability to params in actions to be grabbed from an attribute.
  * I should also automatically add parentId to all childrens spawned.
  * the attribute getter itself should be able to take an attribute getter!!!

* Maybe I should do powerups next, or bomb? or maybe update controls to support more buttons.
