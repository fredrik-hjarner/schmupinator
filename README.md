**Work in progress! Code can break backward compatibility at any time. Code will most likely not stabilize before ~~2023~~ 2024, if I even get it to a stable state at all.**

> The ambition is to make a shoot 'em up maker with the ability for users to create their own shoot 'em up stages.

You can try version 0.6.0 here: https://fredrik-hjarner.github.io/schmupinator/

## Current state

* You can play 2 very short stages, one vertical one horizontal.
* Highscore, separate for each level, that saves in localStorage.
* You can theoretically build your own stages and enemies with JS/TS files, but really, you will need a tutorial or be pretty smart (~~200 IQ~~ 150 IQ) to figure out how to do it.

## Preliminary goals for the game/maker

1. Make it able to do everything that the game *Truxton* can do. *Truxton* is an old shoot 'em up game that is relatively primitive so is easy to *mimic*.
2. Make it *not too hard* to create enemies and stages. A good tutorial and documentation is needed.
3. A dream goal is to create a stage and enemy editor, but in order for that to be feasible the code must first have stabilized.
4. Server that stores highscores and custom stages.

## Preliminary goals for the code

* Robust code that never breaks.
  * Every file edit starts a test that runs a stage (with pre-recorded inputs) from start to finish to assert that behavior is exactly as expected.
* As few dependencies as possible. Fewer dependencies can increase the life span of a project since it will not rely on 1 000 dependences that ~~can~~ *will* break.
  * **The code currently has zero *runtime* dependencies.**
* No canvas or OpenGL. Every enemy, bullet, etc. is a div!

## How to clone, build and run *Schmupinator* locally?

1. Install the requirements if you don't have them.
   - Install `node` (usually lastest version, but use version 18 if you have problems).
   - Install `git` (**optional**).
2. Download repository.
   - Alt 1 - with git
     - Create a directory for *Schmupinator*. Open the created directory in a terminal.
     - Clone repository by running `git clone https://github.com/fredrik-hjarner/schmupinator.git .` in terminal.
   - Alt 2 - without git
     - If you dont want to use git, then download zip-file [here](https://github.com/fredrik-hjarner/schmupinator/archive/refs/heads/vite-master-safe-always-working-not-broken.zip). Extract and open terminal in the extracted directory.
3. Run `npm install` in terminal.
4. Run `npm run dev` in terminal.
   - This should open `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser, if not then open it manually.
