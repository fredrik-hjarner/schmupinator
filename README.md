# Shmupinator

**Attention: Work in progress. Code can break backward compatability at any time. Code will most likely not stabilize before 2023, if I even get it to a stable state at all.**

## Short description

The ambition is to make a shoot 'em up engine with the ability for users create their own games.

## Teasers

`[Insert awesome animation here]`

## Current state

* You can play a stage that lasts 30 seconds.
* Highscore that saves in localStorage (locally in you browser since no server exists currently).
* You can theoretically build your own stages and enemies with YAML files, but really, you will need a tutorial or be pretty smart to figure out how to do it.

## Preliminary goals for the game

1. First goal is to make it able to do everything that the game *Truxton* can do. *Truxton* is a good, imho, shoot 'em up but primitive so is easy to *mimic*.
2. Make it *not too hard* to create enemies and stages. A good tutorial and documentation is needed.
3. A dream goal is to create a stage and enemy editor, but in order for that to be feasible the code must first have stabilized.

## Preliminary goals for the code

* As few dependencies as possible. Fewer dependencies can increase the life span of a project since it will not rely on 1 000 dependences that ~~can~~ *will* break.

## How to clone, build and run *Shumpinator* locally?

`[TODO: Write instructions.]`
